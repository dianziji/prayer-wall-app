# Prayer Edit/Delete Feature Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Database Setup
First, run the RLS migration script:

```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase-migrations-prayers-rls-edit-delete.sql

-- Enable RLS on prayers table (if not already enabled)
ALTER TABLE prayers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can update their own prayers
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own prayers" 
ON prayers FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can delete their own prayers  
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own prayers"
ON prayers FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm test tests/basic.test.ts
npm test tests/utils/time-utils.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Edit/Delete buttons not showing
**Cause**: User not logged in or not owner of prayer  
**Fix**: Verify session state and prayer ownership

### Issue: "Not authorized" error
**Cause**: RLS policies not installed or user trying to edit others' prayers  
**Fix**: Run RLS migration script and verify ownership

### Issue: "Can only edit current week prayers"
**Cause**: Trying to edit prayer from past week  
**Expected**: This is correct behavior, feature working as designed

### Issue: Modal not closing after successful edit
**Cause**: JavaScript error in onPost callback  
**Fix**: Check browser console for errors, verify state management

### Issue: Page not refreshing after delete
**Cause**: onDelete callback not triggering refresh  
**Fix**: Verify refreshKey increment in WeeklyWallClient
